## About Me

I am a techie with interest in Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I have some interest in Computer Architecture as well. 
I did my Master's in Electronic Systems from Dept. of Elec. Engineering, IIT Bombay with strong focus on Signal and Multimedia Procssing.

I recently joined Aditya Imaging Information Technology (AIIT) as Imaging Scientist. Prior to this I was working for around 3 years as 
Design Engineer at Vision processor developement team at Tensilica (Cadence).

In my free time I like to learn Sitar, listen to hindustani classical and fusion music and attend music concerts.
I am also a cycling and swimming entusiast and ocationally go for trekking. When I do none of these, I prefer watching some serious drama movies.
Currently I am working on developing reading as a hoby.
