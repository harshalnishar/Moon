I have decided to mantain this github pages website and blog to put notes of what I learn and also document my hobby projects.

I wanted to start this for a long time, but I was too lazy or apparantly quite busy to start and work towards it. Additionally I am not very good with website developement. So finally I gave up on building my own website and rather forked the template from <a href='https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon'> here </a>

I hope I shall be able to maintain this blog regularly with interesting and useful post about my new learnings.

Thanks for visiting.
